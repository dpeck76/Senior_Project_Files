# Senior Project Files

This repo is for my senior project files that I am creating. I am making an ML model to predict diagnoses from EKG readings. 

### Update: 12/27/2023

Here is the poster I used to present the senior project at the [Research and Creative Works Conference](https://www.byui.edu/research-and-creative-works-conference/). I will continue to update the one up top, so it will likely keep the same general format, but will have several updates to the content so that it stays applicable as I update the project.

### Update: 12/21/2023
I finished my senior project as far as a grade at school is concerned. However, there are still everal things in here that are not to the point that I would like them to be. I will be editing this repo as time allows to make it more professional, presentable, better performing, etc. 

The Heterogeneous model (specifically the serialized one) is the one that I used in the end and have done my best to ensure that it is professional and in working order. The others are still liable to have some messiness, inconsistencies, bugs, etc.
