# Senior Project Files

This repo is for my senior project files that I am creating. I am making an ML model to predict diagnoses from EKG readings. 

### Update: 12/21/2023
I finished my senior project as far as a grade at school is concerned. However, there are still everal things in here that are not to the point that I would like them to be. I will be editing this repo as time allows to make it more professional, presentable, better performing, etc. 

The Heterogeneous model (specifically the serialized one) is the one that I used in the end and have done my best to ensure that it is professional and in working order. The others are still liable to have some messiness, inconsistencies, bugs, etc.
